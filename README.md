# UMINHO-PHD-MSc-Covers
This is repository has templates for generating UMINHO's PhD thesis/MSc dissertations covers (with the spine), back-covers and frontpage.

This is a work in progress. As this work uses PSTricks, to compile this you have to use XeTeX (XeLaTeX), but also because it has UM official fonts (this uses `fontspec`).

The image below is the cover for a PhD Thesis for UMINHO's School of Engineering. Note that the Adobe Illustrator file provided in the UMINHO's official website has a 3mm margin called *bleeding* to give the printing company some leverage to trim the cover. Also, the width of that AI file has a 3mm margin in each side (6mm in total) to also give the printing company some leverage to adjust the width in accordance with the paper type and number of pages.
